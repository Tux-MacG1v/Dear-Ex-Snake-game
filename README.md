# 🎮 Dear Ex Snake

**Dear Ex Snake** is a retro-style, console-based snake game written in C++ for Windows. With heartbreak humor and colorful animations, it’s a personalized twist on the classic arcade snake, made as part of a school undergraduate project in **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

---

## 💡 Description

This game offers a fun and emotional take on the traditional snake game:
- The player (a.k.a. **Victim**) controls a red snake representing their ex.
- Food (green) must be collected while avoiding walls and self-collision.
- The game starts with a themed countdown and ends with a colorful pixel-based "Game Over" box, showing score and stamina (time survived).

This project was developed as part of a **Data Structure and Algorithm course requirement** to demonstrate understanding of core data structures such as arrays, deques, and control loops within a real-time, interactive system.
